# Barometer to SD - Arduino
Small code to use a barometer (to get pressure and temp) on an Arduino Mega/Uno and send it to an SD card.

If you are using an Arduino UNO, the pin 53 used at the line 21 and 23 is not the same, it's 4 or 10 or 11.

Pressure and Temp (in Â°C) are saved in a .csv file (to make a graph easily) but you can change it into .txt or something else.
